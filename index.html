    <h1>Crochet</h1>
    <p><strong>Crochet</strong> (English: /kroʊˈʃeɪ/;[1] French: [kʁɔʃɛ]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'hook'. Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, bone or plastic. The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.</p>
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>19th century crochet from Orvieto, Italy
    Knitted textiles survive from as early as the 11th century CE, but the first substantive evidence of crocheted fabric emerges in Europe during the 19th century. Earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by nålebinding, a different looped yarn technique.</p>
    <p> The first known published instructions for crochet explicitly using that term to describe the craft in its present sense appeared in the Dutch magazine <em>Penélopé</em> in 1823. This includes a colour plate showing five styles of purse, of which three were intended to be crocheted with silk thread.</p>
    <h2>Modern practice and culture</h2>
    <p>The early 21st century has seen a revival of interest in handcrafts and DIY, as well as improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn. As well as books and classes, there are YouTube tutorials and Tiktok videos to help people who may need a clearer explanation to learn how to crochet. Filet crochet, Tunisian crochet, tapestry crochet, broomstick lace, hairpin lace, cro-hooking, and Irish crochet are all variants of the basic crochet method.</p>
    <p>Crochet has experienced a revival on the catwalk as well. Christopher Kane's Fall 2011 Ready-to-Wear collection makes intensive use of the granny square, one of the most basic of crochet motifs. In addition, crochet has been utilized many times by designers on the reality show Project Runway. Websites such as Etsy and Ravelry have made it easier for individual hobbyists to sell and distribute their patterns or projects across the internet.</p>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p>Basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread. Yarn, one of the most commonly used materials for crocheting, has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns. Acrylic can also be used when crocheting, as it is synthetic and an alternative for wool.</p>
    <h3>Crochet hook</h3>
    <p>The crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminium, plastic, and steel. Because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern. </p>
    <h3>Yarn</h3>
    <p>Yarn for crochet is usually sold as balls, or skeins (hanks), although it may also be wound on spools or cones. Skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc. It is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased.</p>
    <h2>Types of stitches</h2>
    <p>There are six main types of basic stitches (the following description uses US crochet terminology which differs from the terminology used in the UK and Europe).</p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Chain stitch</em> - the most basic of all stitches and used to begin most projects.</li>
      <li><em>Slip stitch</em> - used to join chain stitch to form a ring.</li>
      <li><em>Single crochet stitch</em> - (called <em>double crochet stitch</em> in the UK) - easiest stitch to master.</li>
      <li><em>Half-double crochet stitch</em> (called <em>half treble stitch</em> in the UK) - the 'in-between' stitch, sometimes called <em>short double crochet</em> in vintage publications.</li>
      <li><em>Double crochet stitch</em> (called <em>treble stitch</em> in the UK) (yarn over once) - many uses for this unlimited use stitch.</li>
      <li><em>Treble</em> (or triple) crochet stitch (called <em>double treble stitch</em> in the UK) (yarn over twice).</li> 
      </ol>
